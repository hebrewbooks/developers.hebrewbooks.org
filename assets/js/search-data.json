Each book has a number of metadata fields such as title, author, year of publication, page count, etc. These are displayed on the main book information page for each book and some are searchable via search forms on our sites. Book Viewers . Both sites offer users ability to view books page by page, or to download the entire book as a PDF. While both sites offer a PDF-based viewer for page by page turning, the beta site also has an experimental image-based viewer that allows faster browsing through the book. ",
