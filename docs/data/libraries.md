# Metadata for Libraries
## MARC Records for Libraries
We do not provide MARC records to libraries directly. However, most
HebrewBooks.org titles have been uploaded into WorldCat under the
institution code **NYHBW** and should be available in
[OCLC WorldCat](https://www.worldcat.org/) or
[the National Library of Israel (NLI)](https://www.nli.org.il/en).
You can also view most of our titles
[via the WorldCat website](https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=on:DGCNT+DCG_ENTIRE_REPOSITORY+NYHBW&qt=results_page).

## OAI-PMH Gateway
We operate an [OAI-PMH](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/) gateway for use
by libraries and archives. Please contact us at
[oai@hebrewbooks.org](mailto:oai@hebrewbooks.org) for more information.

The metadata in WorldCat and our OAI-PMH gateway is updated on a less frequent
basis than our websites. If you run into problems, please reach out and let
us know.
