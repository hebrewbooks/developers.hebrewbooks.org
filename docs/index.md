# Developer Documentation for HebrewBooks.org
HebrewBooks.org was founded in order to preserve old American Hebrew books
that are out of print and/or circulation. Currently our mission has expanded
to include all Torah books ever written.

On this site, you will find technical documentation targeting developers
that want to interact with content provided by HebrewBooks.org.

This is very much a work in progress and is subject to change.
